# Hello World!

Greetings! You are now visiting my newly redesigned personal developer blog, which was built using NextJS. The previous version of this blog was created using the MERN stack. My goal for this blog is to share my experiences and knowledge as a programmer and computer science student through posts about various technical topics.

Thank you for joining me on this journey as I share my thoughts and insights on the world of programming. Please stay tuned as the blog officially kicks off!
