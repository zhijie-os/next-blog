# Hello World!

Hello and welcome to my newly redesigned personal developer blog! It was built using NextJS, and I decided to switch from the MERN stack in order to improve SEO and get better search engine rankings. As a programmer and computer science student, I want to use this blog to share my experiences and knowledge on various technical topics.

Thank you for visiting and joining me on this journey. I look forward to sharing my thoughts and insights on the world of programming with you. Stay tuned for more updates as the blog officially gets underway!
