# Introduction

In the past, I have tried to improve my algorithm skills but I didn't stick with it. To motivate myself and stay on track, I plan to solve at least one algorithm per day and document my progress in this post. Additionally, I want to practice my favorite programming language, Rust, by writing the code for these algorithms in it. This will help me become more familiar with Rust.
