# Introduction

In the past, I have tried to improve my algorithm skills but I didn't stick with it. To motivate myself and stay on track, I plan to solve at least one algorithm per day and document my progress in this post. Additionally, I want to practice my favorite programming language, Rust, by writing the code for these algorithms in it. This will help me become more familiar with Rust.


# Leetcode

## 1480. Running sum of 1d Array

- Difficulty: Easy
- Link: [1480. Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/description/?envType=study-plan&id=level-1)

### Description

Given an array `nums`. We define a running sum of an array as `runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i])`.

Return the running sum of `nums`.

### Solution

- Runtime: `O(n)`
- Space: `O(n)`

~~~rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn running_sum(nums: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
        let mut sum: i32 = 0;
        let mut results: Vec<i32> = vec![0; nums.len()];
        for i in 0..nums.len() {
            sum += nums[i];
            results[i] = sum;
        }

        results
    }
}
