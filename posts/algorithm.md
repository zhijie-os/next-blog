# Introduction

In the past, I have tried to improve my algorithm skills but I didn't stick with it. To motivate myself and stay on track, I plan to solve at least one algorithm per day and document my progress in this post. Additionally, I want to practice my favorite programming language, Rust, by writing the code for these algorithms in it. This will help me become more familiar with Rust.

# Leetcode

## Two Sum
~~~rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn two_sum(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    for (i, num) in nums.iter().enumerate() {
        if let Some(j) = map.get(target - num) {
            return vec![*j as i32, i as i32];
        }
        map.insert(num, i);
    }
    vec![]
}

fn main() {
    let nums = vec![2, 7, 11, 15];
    let target = 9;
    let result = two_sum(nums, target);
    println!("Two elements that sum to {}: {:?}", target, result);
}
