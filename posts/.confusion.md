# Life Confusion
Life does not make any sense at all. 

It is just confusing. I do not know how 
other people understand their life, but my life is so confusing to a point that 
I do not understand.

I feel the society does not want everyone to be successful, only a few privileged one could win this zero-sum game. It is a exploit machine where the rich always 
hold the greatest power and the poor always suffer.

It is fine, I never experienced a rich life, so I do not know how it feels like.
